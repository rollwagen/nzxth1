### Note on USB-C types
> USB type C ports can be either 9 or 10, which depends on how the hardware deals with the two possible orientations of a USB type C device/cable.
> If a USB-C uses the same SSxx in both orientations, then it has an internal switch (UsbConnector=9).
> If a USB-C uses a different SSxx in each orientation, then it has no switch (UsbConnector=10).
